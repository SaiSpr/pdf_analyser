The development of Vasuki has been a multifaceted journey involving various advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), data management, and user interface design.

Overview: 

1. NLP Techniques and Foundations

Learning Paradigms:

Implementing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning to enable the chatbot to generalize from minimal examples.

Text Summarization:

Developing models to condense lengthy dialogues into concise summaries, aiding coherent response generation.


2. Utilizing Pre-Trained Language Models

Transformer Models:

Leveraging advanced models for summarization, translation, and question answering.

Model Fine-Tuning:

Customizing pre-trained models on specific datasets to enhance targeted application performance.
 

3. Building Vasuki – A Proof of Concept

Dialog Summarization:

Implementing techniques to process and condense dialogue inputs for better context retention and response generation.

Inference Techniques:

Using one-shot and few-shot learning strategies to generate accurate responses with minimal training examples.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

Combining retrieval mechanisms with generative models to create a robust and knowledgeable conversational agent.
 

4. User Interface Development

TruthSeeker Experience:

Drawing from the TruthSeeker project to design an intuitive and interactive UI for Vasuki.
 

5. Comparative Analysis and Evaluation
